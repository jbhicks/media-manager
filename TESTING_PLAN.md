# Testing and Headless Mode Plan

## Objective
Enhance the project with comprehensive testing and a headless mode to facilitate automated testing and improve reliability.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Testing Framework
- Use Go's built-in testing package (`testing`) for unit and integration tests.
- Leverage the `fyne.io/fyne/v2/test` package for graphical application testing.
- Structure tests to cover:
  - Core functionality of the media manager.
  - Edge cases and error handling.
  - Performance benchmarks.
  - GUI interactions using Fyne's testing utilities.

### Testing Framework
1. Identify key functionalities to test.
2. Write unit tests for individual functions.
3. Create integration tests for workflows.
4. Add performance benchmarks.
5. Use `fyne.io/fyne/v2/test` to simulate GUI interactions and validate graphical components.

### Headless Mode
1. Add a `--headless` flag to the application.
2. Modify the main application logic to support headless execution.
3. Ensure compatibility with existing features.
4. Write tests to validate headless mode functionality.

## Benefits
- Improved code reliability and maintainability.
- Easier debugging and regression testing.
- Enhanced developer productivity.

## Approval
Please review and approve this plan to proceed with implementation.
